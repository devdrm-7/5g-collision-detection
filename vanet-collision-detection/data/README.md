## VANET Collision Detection System

This project implements a collision detection system using Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to enhance road safety by enabling vehicles to communicate and share information about their status and potential hazards.

### Data Overview

The data used in this project primarily consists of vehicle position and velocity information, which is communicated between vehicles using VANET protocols. The following files are relevant to the data used in the simulation:

- **simulation/map.net.xml**: Defines the road network layout, including roads, intersections, and traffic signals.
- **simulation/routes.rou.xml**: Contains route definitions for vehicles, specifying their paths through the network.

### Additional Resources

For further information on the datasets and methodologies used in this project, please refer to the documentation provided in the main `README.md` file located in the root directory of the project.
