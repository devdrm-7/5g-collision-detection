Collision Detection System Using 5G VANET: Project Presentation Script
Introduction to VANET and 5G Integration
We are presenting our Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) collision detection system that demonstrates how 5G technology can revolutionize road safety.

VANETs are dynamic networks where vehicles communicate with each other and with roadside infrastructure. Traditional VANETs used dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), but integrating them with 5G cellular networks provides significant advantages:

Ultra-low latency (1-10ms) critical for time-sensitive collision warnings
Higher bandwidth for richer data exchange
Wider coverage area through existing cellular infrastructure
Network slicing capabilities prioritizing safety-critical messages
Our system demonstrates how 5G-enabled vehicles can detect potential collisions and transmit warnings almost instantaneously, potentially saving lives."

Program Flow
"Our collision detection system follows this operational flow:

SUMO traffic simulator generates realistic vehicle movements
At each simulation step, our algorithm collects vehicle position, speed, and direction data
The CollisionDetector analyzes vehicle trajectories to identify potential collision risks
When a collision risk is detected, the VanetNetwork simulates 5G-based communication:
Direct warnings between vehicles on collision course
Network-wide alerts to nearby vehicles
The GUI visualizes collision risks and communication in real-time
All detections and communications are logged for analysis
This system demonstrates both the algorithmic and communication aspects of 5G collision detection."

Component Functions
"Let me explain the key components of our project:

main.py: Orchestrates the simulation, integrating SUMO traffic simulation with our collision detection and communication

collision_detection.py: Implements trajectory prediction algorithms that calculate whether vehicles are on a collision course, using Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics

vanet_communication.py: This is our 5G network simulator. It models:

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication with a 100m range (typical of 5G direct mode)
Packet delivery with configurable reliability (95% in our simulation, similar to 5G)
Message prioritization based on collision severity
Multi-hop data dissemination for network-wide awareness
utils.py: Contains helper functions for calculations and data processing

The system generates both a collision log and a communication log that show when warnings were exchanged and which vehicles received them."

Current Simulation vs. Actual 5G
"To be transparent, our implementation simulates 5G network characteristics rather than using actual 5G protocols. Our vanet_communication.py module:

Models the communication range and reliability expected in 5G networks
Simulates the message exchange that would occur over 5G
Includes realistic packet loss rates similar to 5G environments
However, it doesn't implement:

Actual 5G radio protocols (NR, mmWave)
Network slicing or Quality of Service mechanisms
Detailed signal propagation models
The full 5G protocol stack"
NS3 Integration Benefits
"Integrating with NS3 (Network Simulator 3) would have enhanced our project by:

Providing accurate modeling of 5G radio access networks
Implementing realistic signal propagation, including urban environments
Simulating network congestion and its impact on warning delivery
Testing different 5G deployment scenarios (urban vs. rural)
Evaluating scalability with thousands of connected vehicles
NS3 would have added a layer of network realism, though our current implementation still accurately demonstrates the core collision detection algorithms and warning system."

5G's Role in Collision Detection
"Our system showcases how 5G enables next-generation collision detection through:

Ultra-low latency: Our warnings propagate within milliseconds, matching 5G's 1-10ms latency
Extended range: The 100m transmission range models 5G's device-to-device capabilities
High reliability: Our 95% packet delivery success rate mirrors 5G network reliability
Scalability: The system handles multiple simultaneous warnings, just like a 5G network
Prioritization: Critical collision warnings receive highest priority, similar to 5G network slicing
In a real-world implementation, these messages would be transmitted over 5G infrastructure using C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) protocols, enabling vehicles to communicate with:

Other vehicles (V2V)
Infrastructure (V2I)
Pedestrians' devices (V2P)
The broader network (V2N)"
Conclusion
"In conclusion, our project demonstrates how 5G technology transforms vehicle collision detection systems:

We've shown how predictive algorithms can detect potential collisions before they occur
Our communication model illustrates how these warnings would propagate in a 5G-enabled vehicle network
The simulation proves that even with minor network delays, there's sufficient time for driver warnings or autonomous vehicle responses
While our project uses simulated 5G characteristics, it accurately represents the functionality and benefits of actual 5G-based collision detection systems. The algorithms and communication patterns we've developed would transfer directly to real 5G hardware implementations.

As 5G networks continue to expand, systems like ours will become standard safety features in connected vehicles, potentially saving thousands of lives annually through preventive collision warnings."
